## The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock

>by T.S.Eliot

Let us go then, you and I,\
When the evening is spread out against the sky\
Like a patient etherized upon a table;\
Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,\
The muttering retreats\
Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels\
And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:\
Streets that follow like a tedious argument\
Of insidious intent\
To lead you to an overwhelming question ...\
Oh, do not ask, “What is it?”\
Let us go and make our visit.
